# Churn Analysis and Prediction - End-to-End Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn using SQL Server and Power BI. The goal is to identify patterns in customer attrition and provide insights to improve retention strategies. Using ML models to predict for new data.

## Tech Stack
- **SQL Server** (ETL and Data Processing)
- **Power BI** (Data Visualization)
- **Python, ScikitLearn** (For ML modeling)

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Extraction & Loading**
   - Import customer data (CSV) into SQL Server.

2. **Data Cleaning & Transformation**
   - Handle missing values and standardize formats.
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using SQL queries.
   - Create new features for better insights.

3. **Data Visualization (Power BI)**
   - Develop interactive dashboards.
   - Analyze churn trends based on demographics, payments, and services.
   
4. **Predictive Modeling (Optional)**
   - Train a machine learning model to predict churn.
   - Integrate predictions into Power BI for business insights.

## Key Insights
- Identified high churn rates in specific customer segments.
- Customers with monthly contracts churn more than yearly subscribers.
- Payment method and service usage influence churn probability.
